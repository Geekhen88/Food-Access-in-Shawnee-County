       <p>According to Celia Llopis-Jepsen of the Kansas News Service and National Public Radio- </p>
        
        <h1><i>“1 in 6 Kansans lives in a food desert.”</i></h1>

        <p>“This map, produced by the Kansas Health Institute, shows food insecurity rates by zip code. Two of the zip codes affected by losing the grocery store in central Topeka have the county’s highest rate of people struggling to stock their pantries — nearly a third of the population.”-  Celia Llopis-Jepsen
        
        With so many of our fellow Kansans affected by food insecurity, it’s time to understand the specifics of how it is affecting the 177,000 residents in SHawnee County, Kansas specifically.
        </p>
        <p> If someone does not have their own transportation, they must depend on bussing, or friends to give them a ride to the 
        nearest grocery store. Getting a week’s worth of groceries on the bus is difficult. To supermarket chains, low-income 
        residents without adequate transportation are not very attractive, so they tend to build elsewhere, which exacerbates 
        the problem of food access. 

<h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <p>People living in central Topeka are four times as likely not to have enough food when compared people living in the 
            suburbs of Topeka1</p>
  


<p>In 2019, 11 census tracts in Shawnee County were designated as food deserts, meaning they were identified as areas with 
    limited access to healthy and affordable foods. </p>
