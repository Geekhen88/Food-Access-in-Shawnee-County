       <p> If someone does not have their own transportation, they must depend on bussing, or friends to give them a ride to the 
        nearest grocery store. Getting a weekâ€™s worth of groceries on the bus is difficult. To supermarket chains, low-income 
        residents without adequate transportation are not very attractive, so they tend to build elsewhere, which exacerbates 
        the problem of food access.

<p>In 2019, 11 census tracts in Shawnee County were designated as food deserts, meaning they were identified as areas with 
    limited access to healthy and affordable foods. </p>
